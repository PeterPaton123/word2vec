Your implementation of the CBOW model using Flax and JAX looks structurally sound but there are a few aspects to consider for optimal functionality and efficiency
Parsing Corpus Function In the parse_corpus function the line seems unnecessary and might be an error
It appears to be attempting to split and add the filename itself to the word occurrences which is likely not the intended behavior
Vocabulary Indexing for minus one when handling words not in the vocabulary you're using minus one as the index
This approach works but be cautious as indexing with minus one in Python typically accesses the last element of an array
It seems you've accounted for this in the model's method but ensure this behavior is consistent throughout your code
Embedding Layer in CBOW Class The double vmap usage in the method of the CBOW class might be less efficient
Consider if there's a way to vectorize this operation more directly possibly using advanced indexing techniques or rethinking the input structure
Averaging Context Vectors The TODO comment about trying different averaging strategies is a good point
Weighted averaging could potentially capture more nuanced relationships between context words and the target word
Batch Processing in get_batch The function correctly yields batches of the specified size but be aware that the last batch might be smaller than the others if the number of samples isn't divisible by the batch size. Ensure your model and training loop can handle this case.
Training Loop The loop looks good
It correctly iterates over the epochs and batches updates the model parameters and prints the loss
Just ensure that filepath is set to a valid corpus file
Learning Rate The learning rate is hardcoded in the function
Consider making it a parameter that can be adjusted
Binary Cross-Entropy Function Be cautious with the calculation of the binary crossentropy loss
The current implementation assumes the logits are not passed through a softmax before log softmax is applied
Ensure this aligns with your model output
Model Initialization The model is initialized with a dummy input
Ensure that this shape aligns with your actual input shape during training
Overall your implementation covers the necessary components of a CBOW model
The areas of concern are mostly around efficiency and ensuring the logic aligns with your specific use case and data
Testing with actual data and monitoring the training process will be crucial to validate and potentially tweak the models performance
